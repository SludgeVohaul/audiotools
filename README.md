## Audio Tools

A "collection" of tools for mangling audio content.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
1. Open each script in your editor and check the user configurable settings.

## Platforms

The scripts are shell (bash) scripts, written and tested under OSX.

There should not be any issues on OSX and BSD-like systems, on GNU some of the
used tools will probably have different parameters...
